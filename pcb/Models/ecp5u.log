WARNING - Model hs1120s040eaaaaaaaou: The [Rising Waveform] 
      with [R_fixture]=50 Ohms and [V_fixture]=0.6V
      has TYP column DC endpoints of  0.35V and  0.91v, but
      an equivalent load applied to the model's I-V tables yields
      different voltages ( 0.31V and  0.95V),
      a difference of  6.70% and  6.38%, respectively.
